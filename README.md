# TaskManagement

```
A project that helps us to easily maintain a bunch of titled Task List in which we can include various editable task cards. 
These cards are editable and can be drag and dropped from one to another list.
We can mark status on each card as done/ not done.
Task status is reflected on the card to show if its completed or pending.
