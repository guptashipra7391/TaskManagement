# TaskManagement
A project that helps us to easily maintain a bunch of titled Task List in which we can include various editable task cards. 
These cards are editable and can be drag and dropped from one to another list.We can mark status on each card as done/ not done.

##Following features are implemented in this project

1) User can create multiple lists with an editable title.

2) User can add multiple cards to lists.

(Cards will have a description, a userName to which it is tagged and a status.)

3) Option to delete a list.

4) Option to edit & delete card from a particular list.

5) Option to transfer a card from one list to another (through drag and drop).

6) Data persist after refreshing the page.
